# Contributing Guidelines

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

When reporting an issue, include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work.

Contributions will be reviewed and acknowledged, at minimum, on a weekly basis. PRs will be approved based on the severity of the bug and complexity of the submission.
